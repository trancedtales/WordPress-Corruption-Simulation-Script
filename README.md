# ⚠️ WordPress Corruption Simulation Script (Educational Use Only)

This PHP script demonstrates how a WordPress site can be deliberately rendered inoperable by modifying the database and filesystem. It is meant **solely for educational and security awareness purposes**, and should **never be executed on a live or production environment**.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The script is designed to:
- Show how attackers or misconfigurations can break a WordPress installation.
- Simulate a worst-case scenario for training or security hardening exercises.
- Educate developers and administrators on the importance of backups and secure development practices.

---

## 🚨 What This Script Does

> Running this script will break your WordPress site.

- 🔐 Extracts DB credentials and active theme name from your WordPress setup.
- 🧨 Replaces the `siteurl` and `home` values in the database with a corrupted URL (`http://invalid-url.com`).
- 🧹 Deletes all user accounts by truncating the `wp_users` table.
- 📴 Modifies the active theme’s `functions.php` by appending a `die()` statement.
- 🗃️ Renames the `wp-config.php` file, making the site non-functional.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **This script is highly destructive. Use at your own risk.**

- **DO NOT RUN** on any live or production WordPress installation.
- This script is intended for local environments, testing, or sandboxed VMs only.
